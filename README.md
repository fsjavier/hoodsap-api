## Agile

I've embraced the Agile methodology for project management, utilizing GitHub Projects as the tool for this purpose. Within the project, tasks were organized into Epics to efficiently group related user stories. Each user story has a title, a description, clear acceptance criteria, associated tasks, and tags to effectively categorize them as "must-have," "should-have," or "could-have" features. This structured approach facilitated a dynamic workflow that transitions from "To Do" for pending tasks, to "In Progress" for those under active development, and finally to "Done" upon completion.

### Project Goal

The core objective of Hoodsap is to empower neighborhoods by offering a dynamic platform that encourages community interaction and the exchange of local insights. It aims to streamline the process for residents to post updates, arrange local events, and foster mutual support. Hoodsap serves as a hub for residents who want to stay informed about neighborhood activities, discovering local points of interest, and collaboratively addressing community issues. It is designed to be an useful tool for anyone interested in enriching their neighborhood's collective experience and building a stronger, more connected community.
